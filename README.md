# Portfolio Website – Linux-Style Desktop Experience
A personal portfolio site designed to look and feel like a Linux desktop environment—built completely from scratch without using any UI libraries. It features draggable, resizable, and minimizable windows that simulate a real OS interface while users explore my work, experience, and projects.

## 🚀 Features

Each “app” or “section” of the portfolio opens in a window with:

 - Draggable movement

 - Resizable corners

 - Minimize / Restore functionality

 - Smooth animations and state management

## 📂 Modular Applications

The website is structured like a desktop with apps, such as:

 - About Me

(will add more in the future)
